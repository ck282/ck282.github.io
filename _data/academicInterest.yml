- description: In my academical path I have found a liking to combine my two fields. I enjoy collecting and examining data using methods of the digital humanities and analysing it according to theories of linguistic fields, such as sociolinguistics and pragmatics. For seminars I have used Twitter data to analyse the usage of politeness in Tweets from American and British retail companies and in another case the usage of intensifiers in selected English varieties. My approach is mostly of quantitative nature, with some selected qualitative examples. Since the quality of a study is dependent on its initial data, I like to put special attention on the corpus assemblyand have collected my own data for a study on themes in short stories and for an analysis of topics using topic modeling in fairy tales. Currently, I am trying to familiarize myself with machine learning processes that can support my mostly rule based approaches.
