- description: During my studies I have predominantly linked my two fields of interest. I enjoy collecting and examining data using methods of the digital humanities and analyzing it according to theories of linguistic fields, such as sociolinguistics and pragmatics. <br/>For seminars I have focused on Twitter data I have analysed politeness in Tweets from American and British retail companies and intensifiers in selected English varieties. My approach is mostly of quantitative nature, with some selected qualitative examples. Since the quality of a study depends on its initial data, I place special attention on the corpus assembly. I have collected my own data for a study on themes in short stories and for an analysis of topics in fairy tales using topic modeling. Currently, I am familiarizing myself with machine learning processes to support my mostly rule based approaches.
